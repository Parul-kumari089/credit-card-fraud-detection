💳 AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System

🔗 Live Demo: https://credit-card-fraud-detection-1bed.onrender.com

📌 Overview

This project presents a machine learning-based web application designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. The system classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using advanced data processing and predictive modeling techniques, accessible through an interactive web interface.

🚨 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital payments, credit card fraud has become a critical concern. 
Detecting fraud is challenging due to:

Highly imbalanced datasets (fraud cases are rare)
Complex and hidden patterns in transaction behavior

This project aims to build a reliable system that minimizes financial risk by accurately identifying fraudulent transactions.
